# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this PyBer is to create a complete summary of the Ride-Sharing data by city type. With a quick summary of line, bar, scatter, bubble, pie, and box-and-whisker plots using Matplotlib libraries. And determine mean, median, and mode using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy statistics. Our Final Analysis include multiple-line graphs of total weekly fares for each city type.

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types:

The Suburban fares started around $1,000, and the analysis was not profitable, fare dropped in March and in mid-April.
The Rural fares started at around $200, the analysis shows fares increase and dropped till the end of April.
The Urban fares start with an average of $1,800 with a consistent increase around 2,300.


Summary:Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:

1) We can predict that there are good opportunities to expand the business in rural and suburban cities
2) The Urban cities fare is the highest/consistent, giving us great and new business opportunities to expand rides.
3) The Rural cities fare is the lowest of the other two city types (Urban and Suburban cities), in addition, fares didnt intersect.
